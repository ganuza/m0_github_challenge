# GitHub Steps

Describe in your own words how to establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub.

- create a local repository by making a directory and a file such as index.md withing it
- create a GitHub repository by going to GitHub, clicking New Repo, naming it and hitting the Create repository button
- then make sure you're in the directory where you want to create the connection and copy the "push an existing repo from the command line" commands
- paste into the command line
- open VS Code
- make changes, add, commit
- git push to GitHub repo
